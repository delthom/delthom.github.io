## This One Is Non-negotiable

My oldest son once got hired after being late to both interviews. The youngest went from lugging tools in a warehouse to working for a title company in a shirt and tie.

Before we get to that, let me tell you about the best interview I ever had.

I promise to keep things interesting.
